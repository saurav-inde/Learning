x = 0.1
for s in range(10):
    x += 0.1
print(x)    
##prints 1.0999999999999999
## reason is accumilation of those approximations in lecture 5 notes
##print command has done rounding

## in terminal//
##a = math.sqrt(2)
##a*a
##2.0000000000000004 as in a approximations were stored
##assert statement checks if requred condition is met by user input
